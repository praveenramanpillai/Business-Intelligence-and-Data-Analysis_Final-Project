## ðŸ”¹ Key Objectives
- Assess the number of active Medicaid patients per provider.
- Compare service categories by patient volume.
- Analyze variations in care intensity across RUCA (rural-urban) categories.
- Visualize state and county-level patterns in managed care services.

## ðŸ”¹ Datasets Used
- `Medicaid_Managed_Care_Q4_2024.csv`
- `Medicare_IP_Hospitals_by_Geography_and_Service_2023.csv`
- `Medicare_IP_Hospitals_by_Provider_and_Service_2023.csv`

## ðŸ”¹ Methods
- Data cleaning with pandas: type conversions, handling missing values.
- Grouped aggregations to calculate total active patients and payment amounts.
- Visualizations: bar charts, pie charts, and combined bar-line graphs using matplotlib.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights
- Patient and provider distributions vary significantly across states and service categories.
- Several RUCA categories show disparities in active patient volumes, indicating potential inequities in access.
- Gaps in average payment data suggest areas needing further data validation.
